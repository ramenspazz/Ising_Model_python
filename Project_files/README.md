# Using Jupyter notebooks with python modules
If you are using a Jupyter notebook (ipynb extenstion), you can place them in the ipynb_files directory for easy project management and organization.
# WARNING
Jupyter notebooks as ran by the jupyter notebook service themselves are clunky and do not allow external files without a lot of finaggling, so I recommend using visual studio code.
